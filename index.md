##[FAA Airport Closures](http://feomike.github.com/posts/2013/faa_closure)
On Friday, March 22, 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration released this [press release](http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=14414) describing a "decision that 149 federal contract towers will close beginning April 7 as part of the agencyâ€™s sequestration implementation plan." 

In addition to the release was a [document](http://www.faa.gov/news/media/fct_closed.pdf) listing the individual name, city, state and airport identification signs of those towers to be closed.

Working on a previous [conclusion](http://feomike.github.com/posts/2013/state_seq) that perhaps PDFs are not a great way to release data, and that indeed information like this is a) easy to produce and b) very cheap to publish and host as rich interactive content, I took the short time to open this data and make it releaseable.  Below is the dynamic map which is the result.

##[Example State Sequester](http://feomike.github.com/posts/2013/state_seq)
I wanted to test some ideas brewing around

1. data as part of the web ecology and
2. launching interactive maps and visualizations with no software costs and no hardware costs or infrastructure.

As an example this is a useful model for repeating. More to learn here but this is curious.

#Background
On Sunday, February 25, 2013, the White House released documents detailing the projected costs to states of the upcoming sequester. Several news outlets carried the story - see [this Washington Post article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/white-house-releases-state-by-state-breakdown-of-sequesters-effects/2013/02/24/caeb71a0-7ec0-11e2-a350-49866afab584_story.html). However, only [the Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/24/sequester-states_n_2755181.html) had links to each individual state document.

Surprised at how these documents had real data, but were presented in pdfs, a colleague, [@LearonDalby](https://twitter.com/LearonDalby), and I were discussing how this data could be much better presented. We decided late Sunday night to enter the data into a machine readable format and begin a small project for visualizing the data.
